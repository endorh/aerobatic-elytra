# Aerobatic Elytra
Minecraft mod that adds an aerobatic elytra, which is able to roll and propel
itself using rockets.

During aerobatic flight, mouse movement controls pitch and roll
tilt instead of directly rotating the camera.

Essentially, it's a flight simulator in Minecraft.

## Other features
- Server-configurable physics and upgrades (speed, underwater flight, ...)
- The aerobatic elytra may be dyed as leather armor, or
  imprinted with a banner, displaying the pattern on the wings.
  Inspired on [Customizable Elytra](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/customizable-elytra)
- Customizable trail by attaching up to 4 firework rockets
  to the elytra
- Switch to the classic elytra flight with a key
- Other mods may add more flight mods, such as
  [Aerobatic Elytra Jetpack](https://github.com/endorh/aerobatic-elytra-jetpack)
- Datapacks can add new upgrades, potion effects while flying under arbitrary
  conditions, replace elytras found in End Ships depending on the distance to the
  center of the End, nerf the elytra to require upgrades or have less
  flight autonomy, and more!
  Some example datapacks come bundled with the mod
  and can be installed (extracted into the `datapacks` folder of the server)
  with the `/aerobaticelytra datapack` command.

## Help and Documentation
You can check the [wiki](https://github.com/endorh/aerobatic-elytra/wiki)
if you need help using this mod.

If you're a mod developer willing to add new flight modes, you  can check the
[Aerobatic Elytra Jetpack](https://github.com/endorh/aerobatic-elytra-jetpack)
mod as an example. Most of the extension APIs should be documented as well.

If you're a modpack developer, you may take inspiration from the
[bundled datapacks](https://github.com/endorh/aerobatic-elytra/tree/1.19/src/main/resources/data/aerobaticelytra/datapacks).
